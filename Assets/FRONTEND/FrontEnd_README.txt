// FRONT-END File Structure

The FRONTEND folder will be where we store working ideas and development for the front-end

Important to use the following guidelines so 
that we avoid merge conflicts during development

1. Within the FRONTEND folder - create your OWN folder for each individual task.
	Example: FRONTEND/EmailFunctionality/
			 FRONTEND/ARGazeInteraction/
			 FRONTEND/Detector/

2. Within this folder. Create any subfolders you may need to organise that task.
	Example: FRONTEND/Detector/Scripts/
			 FRONTEND/Detector/Meshes/
			 FRONTEND/Detector/Materials/
			 FRONTEND/Detector/Scenes/

3. When you are staging changes to the repository, only include the folders you
   have created/changed - and exclude any other unnecessary unity packages / metadata

If we follow these guidelines, then every time you stage changes
on the GIT repo - those changes will all be self-contained and will
not clash with other peoples work.
