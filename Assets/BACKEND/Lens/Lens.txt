Varibles:
radius1 and radius2 are the dadii of the two spheres define the lens. 1 is for the lens at z>0 and 2 for z<0. Z is consideret in local space.

length is the radius of the actial lens.

thinkness is the distance between the two spherical surfaces at the edge of the lens.

delta is used for checking differences between two vetors

functions:

Start check if the given values create a possible lens

Intecation with discretebeam gets the beams and prepares them for multithreaded calculation and assigns the value after calculation.

ParallelLensInteraction calculates the passing through the lens for the beams one at a time.

refracting sigle beams collects the logic. depending on the radii it calculates the collision position at entry an exit also the direction after each.

Other functions are self explanatory by their name.
